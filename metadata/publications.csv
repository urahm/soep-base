Whereas some people enjoy good physical and cognitive health into old age, others suffer from a multitude of age-related disorders and impairments which reduce life expectancy and affect quality of life. To identify and characterize the factors associated with ‘healthy’ vs. ‘unhealthy’ ageing, we have launched the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), a multidisciplinary and multiinstitutional project that ascertains a large number of ageing-related variables from a wide range of different functional domains. Phenotypic assessments include factors related to geriatrics and internal medicine, immunology, genetics, psychology, sociology and economics. Baseline recruitment of the BASE-II cohort was recently completed and has led to the sampling of 1600 older adults (age range 60–80 years), as well as 600 younger adults (20–35 years) serving as the basic population for in-depth analyses. BASE-II data are linked to the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), a long-running panel survey representative of the German population, to estimate sample selectivity. A major goal of BASE-II is to facilitate collaboration with other research groups by freely sharing relevant phenotypic and genotypic data with qualified outside investigators.","Lars Bertram, Anke Böckenhoff, Ilja Demuth, Sandra Düzel, Rahel Eckardt, Shu-Chen Li, Ulman Lindenberger, Graham Pawelec, Thomas Siedler, Gert G.

Wagner",2013,"The Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) is a multidisciplinary study that allows for the investigation of how a multitude of health status factors as well as many other social and economic outcomes interplay. The sample consists of 1,600 participants aged 60 to 80, and 600 participants aged 20 to 35. The socio-economic part of BASE-II, the so called SOEPBASE, is conducted by the SOEP Group at the DIW Berlin. The surveyed socio-economic variables are fully comparable with the variables of the long running German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), which increases the analytical power of BASE-II. The socioeconomic data collected on the individual and on the household level are enriched with georeferenced context data (“neighbourhood data”) in order to disentangle the interplay between individual, societal and regional determinants on individuals’ health status and other outcome variables. Furthermore, as the BASE-II study is based on a convenience sample, the SOEP Group at the DIW provides weights for the BASE-II dataset that correct for selectivity bias.

Der sozioökonomische Teil von BASE-II wird von der SOEP-Gruppe am DIW Berlin durchgeführt und die entsprechenden SOEP-BASE-Daten mit den SOEP-Daten voll vergleichbar gemacht. Daten liegen sowohl auf der Individualebene als auch auf Haushaltsebene vor und werden mit geo-referenzierten Kontext-Daten (auf der Ebene von „Nachbarschaften“) angereichert, sodass das Zusammenspiel von individuellen, gesellschaftlichen und regionalen Determinanten auf den individuellen Gesundheitszustand und andere Outcome-Variablen herausgearbeitet werden kann. Da die BASE-II Studie auf einem Convenience-Sample beruht, werden extensive Selektions-Analysen durchgeführt und darauf aufbauend wird der BASE-II Datensatz mit Gewichten versehen, die für Selektionsverzerrungen korrigieren.","Anke Boeckenhoff, Denise Sassenroth, Martin Kroh, Thomas Siedler, Peter Eibich, Gert G.

Wagner",2013,"Like many medical studies, the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) is based on a non-random “convenience sample” of self-recruited participants. To study processes of selectivity in BASE-II, we used a questionnaire to compare BASE-II with a large, representative reference study, the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), thereby allowing differences in characteristics of participants in BASE-II and SOEP to be analysed easily. Based on this selectivity analysis, we then generated propensity score weights that adjust for the selectivity in the BASE-II survey.

Wagner",2015,"Aircraft noise is a particularly problematic source of noise as many airports are located in or near major cities and, as a result, densely populated areas are affected. Data from the Berlin Aging Study II (Berliner Altersstudie II, BASE-II), whose socio-economic module is based on the longitudinal Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) study which has been conducted since 1984, allows us to examine the effect of different levels of aircraft noise on the subjective well-being and health of the older residents of a major city, in this case Berlin. The findings show that the presence of aircraft noise, also measured using objective aircraft noise data, is associated with significantly reduced well-being, lower satisfaction with one’s living environment, and poorer health. The association between well-being and a crossing altitude reduced by 100 meters is given certain assumptions — for crossing altitudes of between 1,000 and 2,500 m — comparable to an income loss of between 30 and 117 euros per month.","Peter Eibich, Konstantin A.

We reduce concerns about endogeneity by employing fixed-effects (within) estimators, with individual and city of residence fixed effects, while controlling for a rich set of observables. The results show that access to green urban areas, such as gardens and parks, is positively associated with, whereas access to abandoned areas, such as waste or leftover land, is negatively associated with life satisfaction. The effects are strongest for residents who are older, accounting for up to a third of the size of the effect of being unemployed on life satisfaction. We calculate the marginal willingness-to-pay of residents in order to have access to green urban and abandoned areas in their surroundings, as well as the life-satisfaction maximising amounts of them. Finally, we provide a policy case study, while discussing limitations and avenues for future research.","Christian Krekel, Jens Kolbe, Henry Wüstemann. 2016: The Greener, The Happier?

Secular increases favoring later-born cohorts in fluid intelligence measures are widely documented for young adults. In the current study, we quantify such trends in old age using data from highly comparable participants living in a narrowly defined geographical area and examine whether these trends generalize to quality of life indicators. To do so, we compared data obtained 20 years apart in the Berlin Aging Study (in 1990–93) and the Berlin Aging Study II (in 2013–14), applied a case-matched control design (per cohort, n = 161, Mage = 75), quantified sample selection using a nationally representative sample as the reference, and controlled for number of physical diseases. The later cohort performed better on the fluid intelligence measure (d = .85) and reported higher morale, less negative affect, and more positive affect (ds > .39) than the earlier cohort. We conclude that secular advances have resulted in better cognitive performance and perceived quality of life among older adults and discuss when and how advantages of later cohorts reach their limits.","Denis Gerstorf, Gizem Hülür, Johanna Drewelies, Peter Eibich, Sandra Duezel, Ilja Demuth, Paolo Ghisletta, Elisabeth Steinhagen-Thiessen, Gert G.

9391,"Associations between Neighborhood Characteristics, Well-Being and Health Vary over the Life Course","Peter Eibich, Christian Krekel, Ilja Demuth, Gert G. Wagner",2016,"Background: Neighborhood characteristics are important determinants of individual health and well-being. For example, characteristics such as noise and pollution affect health directly, while other characteristics affect health and well-being by either providing resources (e.g. social capital in the neighborhood), which individuals can use to cope with health problems, or limiting the use thereof (e.g. crime). This also suggests that there might be age differentials in the impact of these characteristics, since individuals at different stages of life might need different resources. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on age differentials in associations between well-being, health, and neighborhood characteristics. Objective: This paper studies associations between a wide range of neighborhood characteristics with the health and well-being of residents of the greater Berlin area. In particular, we focus on differences in the effects between younger (aged 20-35) and older (aged 60+) residents. Methods: We used data from the Berlin Aging Study II (312 younger and 993 older residents of the Berlin metropolitan area in Germany). We used survey data on health and well-being, combined these with subjective perceptions of the neighborhood, and geo-referenced indicators on the neighborhood, e.g. amenities (public transport, physicians, and hospitals). Results: The results show that access to public transportation is associated with better outcomes on all measures of health and well-being, and social support is associated with higher life satisfaction and better mental health. There are considerable differences between both age groups: while the associations between access to public transport and health and well-being are similar for both age groups, neighborhood social capital shows stronger associations for older residents. However, the difference is not always statistically significant. Conclusion: Having access to services is associated with better health and well-being regardless of age. Local policy makers should focus on lowering barriers to mobility in order to improve the health and well-being of the population. Since the social capital of a neighborhood is associated with better health and well-being among older residents, investments that increase social capital (e.g. community centers) might be warranted in neighborhoods with higher shares of older residents.","Peter Eibich, Christian Krekel, Ilja Demuth, Gert G.

We studied the association of different types of sports across different stages of life on relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) in advanced age.815 participants (397 men) from the Berlin Aging Study II aged over 61 years were included in the analysis. rLTL was measured by real time PCR and physical activity was determined retrospectively by questionnaire, assessing type and duration of sports in the past as well as currently. Five separate multiple linear regression models adjusted for various control variables were performed. 67.3% of participants exercised currently, whereas 19.4% performed sports only between the age of 20 and 30. rLTL was higher in subjects who stated to exercise currently (N = 456), and in subjects who engaged in endurance (N = 138) or intensive activity sports (N = 32). Current physical activity was positively associated with rLTL in the risk factor adjusted regression model (ß = 0.26, p < 0.001) and practicing sports for a minimum of 10 years preceding the assessment had a significant effect on rLTL (ß = 0.39, p = 0.011). The highest impact was seen for intensive activity sports (ß = 0.79, p < 0.001) and physical activity since at least 42 years (ß = 0.47, p = 0.001). However, physical activity only between 20 and 30 years of age did not affect rLTL in old age when compared to no sports at all (ß = -0.16, p = 0.21). Physical activity is clearly associated with longer rLTL. The effect is seen with longer periods of physical activity (at least 10 years), with intensive sports activities having the greatest impact on rLTL. Our data suggest that regular physical activity for at least 10 years is necessary to achieve a sustained effect on rLTL.","Denise Saßenroth, Antje Meyer, Bastian Salewsky, Martin Kroh, Kristina Norman, Elisabeth Steinhagen-Thiessen, Ilja Demuth. 2015: Sports and Exercise at Different Ages and Leukocyte Telomere Length in Later Life – Data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways.

Increases in fluid cognitive performance over the last century are well documented and researchers have begun examining historical trends in personality and subjective well-being in old age. Relatively less is known about secular changes in other key components of psychosocial function among older adults. Objective: In the present study, we examined cohort differences in key components of psychosocial function, including subjective age, control beliefs, and perceived social integration, as indicated by loneliness and availability of very close others. Methods: We compared data obtained 20 years apart in the Berlin Aging Study (in 1990-1993) and the Berlin Aging Study II (in 2013-2014) and identified case-matched cohort groups based on age, gender, cohort-normed education, and marital or partner status (n = 153 in each cohort, mean age = 75 years). In follow-up analyses, we controlled for having lived in former East versus West Germany, physical diseases, cohort-normed household income, cognitive performance, and the presence of a religious affiliation. Results: Consistently across analyses, we found that, relative to the earlier-born BASE cohort (year of birth: mean = 1916; SD = 3.38 years; range = 1901-1922), participants in the BASE-II sample (year of birth: mean = 1939; SD = 3.22 years; range = 1925-1949) reported lower levels of external control beliefs (d = -1.01) and loneliness (d = -0.63). Cohorts did not differ in subjective age, availability of very close others, and internal control beliefs. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings suggest that some aspects of psychosocial function of older adults have improved across the two recent decades. We discuss the possible role of sociocultural factors that might have led to the observed set of cohort differences.","Gizem Hülür, Johanna Drewelies, Peter Eibich, Sandra Düzel, Ilja Demuth, Paolo Ghisletta, Elisabeth Steinhagen-Thiessen, Gert G.

We did so by using cohort members’ polygenic profile score for education to predict their parents’ longevity. Across the three cohorts, meta-analysis showed that a 1 SD higher polygenic education score was associated with ~2.7% lower mortality risk for both mothers (total ndeaths = 79,702) and ~2.4% lower risk for fathers (total ndeaths = 97,630). On average, the parents of offspring in the upper third of the polygenic score distribution lived 0.55 y longer compared with those of offspring in the lower third.

This global trend takes place despite the fact that established knowledge of its consequences on response error is incomplete. This paper studies differences between a web (CAWI) and a mailed version (MAIL) of a questionnaire in various forms of response error, namely item nonresponse, satisficing, person-reliability, and social desirable responding. We posit 1) that response error depends on respondents cognitive functioning, namely in the domains of global reading abilities, fluid intelligence, as well as working and episodic memory; and 2) that these effects differ across modes of data collection with generally higher prevalence in the CAWI mode since this mode is more demanding. The analysis builds on a randomized mode experiment implemented in the context of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), a survey that primarily focuses on multidimensional processes of physical and mental aging (see Bertram et al. 2014). The analysis reveals a high impact of cognitive functioning at the various stages of the survey response process. While we do found moderate mode-differences in response error, such as higher item nonresponse rates in the CAWI mode, we did not find cognitive functioning to be a better predictor of response error in web-based interviewing.","Martin Kroh, Denise Lüdtke, Sandra Düzel, Florin Winter. 2016: Response Error in a Web Survey and a Mailed Questionnaire: The Role of Cognitive Functioning.

Abramson, Jan Goebel, Gert G. Wagner, Ilja Demuth, Jean Krutmann, Tamara Schikowski",2019,"During the last two decades, it has been well established that a short-term exposure to ozone (O3) elicits an oxidative stress response in human and mouse skin, which leads to aberrant transcriptional expression of genes consistent with increased skin aging. Whether a long-term exposure to ambient O3 is associated with any skin aging traits, has remained unclear. We addressed this question in two elderly German cohorts: the SALIA study (806 women aged 66–79<U+202F>years), and the BASE-II study (1207 men and women aged 60–84<U+202F>years). Five-year mean residential exposure to O3 was modeled as the number of days with maximum daily 8-h mean O3 concentrations =120<U+202F>µg/m3 per year in the wider neighborhood (5-digit postcode) of a participant's residence. Extrinsic (environmentally induced) skin aging traits – coarse wrinkles and pigment spots (lentigines) on the face – were assessed by means of SCINEXA™, a validated visual score previously shown to be well suited to measure extrinsic facial skin aging in cohort studies. We observed positive associations of O3 exceedances with coarse wrinkles in the face, but not with pigment spots. These associations were present in each cohort as well as in the combined sample of both cohorts. They were independent of chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure as the most obvious confounder, and also of co-pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Thus, long-term exposure to elevated concentrations of tropospheric O3 appears to contribute to skin aging.","Kateryna B. Fuks, Anke Hüls, Dorothea Sugiri, Hicran Altug, Andrea Vierkötter, Michael J.

Wagner, Ulman Lindenberger, Elisabeth Steinhagen-Thiessen, Denis Gerstorf, Ilja Demuth",2018,"Background: The last decades have seen great advances in the understanding, treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although mortality rates due to CVD have declined significantly in the last decades, the burden of CVD is still high, particularly in older adults. This raises the question whether contemporary populations of older adults are experiencing better or worse objective as well as subjective health than earlier-born cohorts. The aim of this study was to examine differences in modifiable indicators of cardiovascular health (CVH), comparing data obtained 20 years apart in the Berlin Aging Study (BASE, 1990–93) and the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II, 2009–2014). Methods: Serial cross-sectional analysis of 242 propensity-score-matched participants of BASE (born 1907–1922) and BASE-II (born 1925–1942). Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, total cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), diet, smoking and physical activity were operationalized according to the “Life’s simple 7“(LS7) criteria of the American Heart Association. Results: 121 matched pairs were identified based on age, sex, and education. In the later-born BASE-II sample, the mean LS7 score was significantly higher than in the earlier-born sample (7.8±1.8 vs. 6.4±2.1, p<0.001), indicating better CVH. In detail, diet, physical activity, smoking, cholesterol, and HbA1c were more favorable, whereas blood pressure was significantly higher in individuals from the later-born cohort. BMI did not differ significantly between the two matched samples. Notably, despite better CVH, later-born individuals (BASE-II) reported lower self-rated health, presumably because of higher health expectations. Conclusions: Overall, cardiovascular health was significantly better in the later-born cohort, but several notable exceptions exist.","Maximilian König, Johanna Drewelies, Kristina Norman, Dominik Spira, Nikolaus Buchmann, Gizem Hülür, Peter Eibich, Gert G.

Durch sein Handeln verändert der Mensch seine Umwelt und er wird durch die Umgebung in seinem Verhalten im Raum beeinflusst. Deshalb stellt der Raum für die Erforschung von sozialen Fragestellungen eine bedeutende Rolle dar. Für die physische Erfassung des Raumes und seiner Merkmale hat sich die Erdbeobachtung als effizientes Werkzeug etabliert. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist das übergeordnete Ziel dieser Dissertation die Ableitung räumlicher Merkmale städtischer Räume aus Fernerkundungsdaten für die Einbindung in sozialwissenschaftliche Studien am Beispiel der beiden Städte Berlin und München. Für die Erarbeitung dieses Ziels wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit ein konzeptioneller Rahmen erstellt, der die Verknüpfung von Erdbeobachtungsdaten und sozialwissenschaftlichen Daten der sozioökonomischen Langzeitstudien SOEP und BASE-II beschreibt. Die Adressdaten der Teilnehmer können zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte der Studien räumlich verarbeitet werden, ohne dabei den Datenschutz zu verletzen. Die physische Charakterisierung des Raumes erfolgt auf Basis hoch aufgelöster, optischer Satellitenbilddaten für die Erfassung der Landbedeckung und digitaler Oberflächenmodelle (DOM) für die Ableitung von Einzelgebäuden, welche die Bebauungsstruktur beschreiben. Dabei werden in einem objektorientierten Bildanalyseverfahren die Informationen aus dem Satellitenbild und dem DOM komplementär verwendet. Für die Einzelgebäude wird darüber hinaus auch noch ein Verfahren zur Abschätzung der Geschosszahl entwickelt und einzelne Gebäudetypen werden auf Basis von 2D und 3D Formmerkmalen klassifiziert. Die aus den Fernerkundungsdaten abgeleiteten physischen Merkmale werden auf der räumlich übergeordneten Ebene des Baublocks zu Nachbarschaftsmerkmalen zusammengefasst und stellen die räumlichen Kontextmerkmale für die sozialwissenschaftliche Analyse dar. Diese Nachbarschaftsmerkmale werden mit den Daten sozialwissenschaftlicher Surveys verknüpft, wodurch im erstellten Datensatz sowohl die sozioökonomischen Merkmale als auch die räumlichen Kontextmerkmale aus den Fernerkundungsdaten zur Verfügung stehen. Durch die Analyse beider Informationen werden die unterschiedlichen räumlichen Bezüge der Surveydaten und der räumlichen Kontextmerkmale untersucht. Konkret wird anhand einer empirischen Untersuchung zur innerstädtischen, räumlichen Segregation des Haushaltseinkommens sowohl die Möglichkeit zur technischen Integrierung der räumlichen Merkmale evaluiert, als auch quantitative Beziehungen zwischen sozioökonomischen und räumlichen Merkmalen untersucht. Sie zeigen, dass der Raum in Kombination mit Informationen über Personen und Haushaltsdaten aus den Surveys einen relevanten, zusätzlichen Erklärungsgehalt in statistischen, sozialwissenschaftlichen Modellen aufweist. Humans change and shape the landscape. There exists a reciprocal relationship, whereby the natural environment is affected by human activities, while the physical landscape affects the behavior of people. This provides context for social scientific research. For the physical detection of space and its characteristics, earth observation can be considered as an established tool. Against this background, the major goal in this dissertation is the derivation of spatial features in urban areas derived by remote sensing data for the integration into socio-economic studies by the example of the two cities, Berlin and Munich. To reach this goal, a conceptual framework is developed in the context of this thesis. This framework describes the linking of remote sensing data and social scientific data from the socio-economical surveys SOEP and BASE-II. The address information of the participants of these studies can be processed spatially for the first time in the history of these studies, without impacting individual data protection. The physical characterization of space is achieved with high resolution satellite images and digital surface models. These data sets are used to derive land cover classifications and individual building footprints, including their height to describe the development structure. An object-based image analysis procedure is then applied to extract the complementary information from both data sets. For the individual buildings another procedure is applied to estimate the number of building levels and several building types are classified by 2D and 3D features. All the derived physical features from the remote sensing data are summarized on the spatial level of the building block and represent the contextual features for the social scientific analysis. Those contextual features are linked with the data of the socio-economic surveys. Hence, both information from the contextual features and socio-economic features from the surveys are accessible for the analysis. By analyzing both information types, the various spatial references are investigated. Specifically, an empirical study is performed to investigate the intra-urban spatial segregation of household incomes. Additionally, potential for the technical integration of spatial features, as well as the quantitative relationships between socio-economic and spatial features, are investigated. They show that space, in combination with information about individuals and households from the surveys, shows additional, relevant explanatory information in statistical social scientific models.","Michael Wurm. 2013: Verknüpfung von Fernerkundungsdaten und Survey-Daten (SOEP und BASE-II) in städtischen Räumen für sozialwissenschaftliche Analysen (Dissertation).

Böhm, Simone Freitag",2016,"Seit den 1980er Jahren untersuchen Forscher den positiven Einfluss von Tieren auf die menschliche Gesundheit. Die aktuelle Studienlage ist durch Heterogenität der Befunde, Seltenheit von Längsschnittstudien, wenige Studien mit deutscher Bevölkerung und der Suche nach Moderatoren und Mediatoren zur Erklärung des möglichen Zusammenhangs gekennzeichnet. Ziel dieser Untersuchung ist eine quer- und längsschnittliche Betrachtung des (möglicherweise unterschiedlichen) Einflusses von Hunden und Katzen auf v. a. die subjektive mentale und physische Gesundheit ihrer Besitzer in einer deutschen Stichprobe mit älteren Menschen, da diese Personengruppe womöglich besonders von den Gesundheitsgewinnen durch Heimtiere profitiert. Weiterhin werden neben demografischen Faktoren auch Einsamkeit und menschliche soziale Unterstützung der Besitzer als potentielle Wirkmechanismen auf querschnittlicher Ebene betrachtet. Es werden sozioökonomische Daten der Berliner Altersstudie II verwendet. Die Gesamtstichprobe umfasst 1 286 ältere Personen ab 60 Jahren, welche 2012 und 2014 an der Fragebogenerhebung teilnahmen. Die Querschnittsbefunde zeigen überwiegend eine schlechtere mentale und physische Gesundheit bei Heimtierbesitzern im Vergleich zu Nicht-Heimtierbesitzern, auch unter Berücksichtigung demografischer Charakteristika der (Nicht-) Besitzer. Lediglich die gesundheitlichen Nachteile der Katzenbesitzer können durch ihre Einsamkeitsgefühle erklärt werden, während für Hundebesitz kein erklärendes Konstrukt in dieser Untersuchung gefunden wird. Auf längsschnittlicher Ebene lassen sich allerdings v. a. mentale Verbesserungen bei Heimtier-, insb. Hundeerwerb im Vergleich zu dauerhaftem Nicht-Heimtierbesitz feststellen, während dauerhafter Heimtierbesitz nicht mit (weiteren) gesundheitlichen Gewinnen einherzugehen scheint und Katzenverlust physische Gesundheitsverbesserungen birgt. Die vorliegende Untersuchung bestätigt die Wichtigkeit längsschnittlicher Analysen, deckt Unterschiede zwischen Hunde- und Katzenbesitz auf, und rückt die Frage der Kurz- oder Langfristigkeit und möglichen Grenzen der gesundheitlichen Effekte durch Heimtierbesitz bei älteren Personen in den Vordergrund.       Since the 1980s researchers are investigating the beneficial effects of pets on human health. The current state of research is characterized by heterogeneity of results, rarity of longitudinal analysis, few studies with German population and search for moderators and mediators in order to explain the possible association. The present study aims at examining the (possibly differential) impact of dogs and cats primarily on their owner’s self-rated physical and mental health both, cross-sectional and longitudinal, using a German sample of elderly as in particular older people may benefit from pet ownership. In addition to demographic characteristics, the owner’s loneliness and human social support are investigated cross-sectional for being potential mediators. Socioeconomic data is provided by the Berliner Altersstudie II. The total sample comprises 1 286 people aged 60 years or older, who completed the survey questionnaire 2012 and 2014. Cross-sectional results predominantly show inferior physical and mental health of pet owners compared to nonowners, even if considering the (non-) owner’s demographic characteristics. Merely the cat owner’s disadvantages in health can be explained by the owner’s feeling of loneliness, whereas no explanatory construct can be found accounting for dog ownership in this study. However, longitudinal results most notably reveal gains in mental health after pet, especially dog acquisition compared to permanent non-ownership, whilst permanent pet ownership is not accompanied with (any more) advantages in health and loss of a cat seems to provide gains in physical health. The present study confirms the importance of longitudinal analysis, indicates differences between cat and dog ownership and spotlights the question of short or long term effects as well as possible limits of the improvement of the elderly pet owner’s health.","Marie S.
